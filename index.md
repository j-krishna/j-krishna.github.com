## Hello 

Welcome to my new and shiny blog.

This is using Jekyll with github. You can read more about setting up a blog here [Jekyll Quick Start](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html).

The theme and the design is forked from [Joe](https://github.com/JoeHand). Thanks Joe.

Next up. 
* Making a habit of regular posting
