<p>I am a very curious person, intrigued by many things. My thoughts revolve around data visualization, urban planning and transportation, economics, and morality. Since coming to Portland, Oregon for college I have called it my home. The city is a beautiful mix of people, interests, and environment.</p>

<h3>Work</h3>
<p>I work at <a href="http://periscopic.com">Periscopic</a>, a socially-conscious data visualization company. After joining Periscopic as an intern, they took a liking to me. Now I manage many of the great projects we create.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>
<p>In 2009, I graduated with a bachelors from Reed College. While at Reed I studied mathematics and economics. In my thesis I wrote about a the macroeconomic effects of creative destruction. I am still very interested in the idea of creative destruction and its implications today.</p>

<h3>Fun Facts</h3>
<p>I get places on my bike. It is a stable steed built by Kona. Like me, it is simple yet efficient; its sole fixed gear gets the job done. Every day I enjoy my ride to work, rain or shine. But let's face it - the ride is especially nice when it is sunny.

<p>Born and raised near Denver, Colorado, I always am attracted towards the outdoors and mountains.</p>

<p>That moment when you understand how or why something works brings me more satisfaction than anything. I also like to make <a href="/cookies">cookies</a> - the chewy, warm, delicious chocolate chip kind.</p>

<p>You can find me other places on the web:</p>
